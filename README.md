# Welcome to Cursor!

Thanks for trying out the beta of Cursor, a VSCode-based code editor built for pair-programming with AI.

**To get started, click on `projects/` and then the folder of your favoriate language (e.g. `projects/python`).**

## Importing Settings

Hit the gear in the top right and click the "Import from VSCode" button.

## Features

### Chat

Hit Cmd+L or Ctrl+L. People use this to find bugs, explain code, ask about how to use an open source library.

To have it focus on a particular block of code, highlight with your mouse and then hit Command+L.

### Edit

When you want the AI to change some code for you, use your mouse to select the code. Then, hit Cmd+K or Ctrl+K.

### Generate

With no code highlighted, hit Cmd+K or Ctrl+K.

### Fix bugs

Hover over linter errors and click "Fix in chat" to have the AI figure out how to fix it. 

## What can the AI see?

For all the features, the AI can see the code in your immediate file. To have it look at particular methods or classes, try writing \`classname\` in your prompt.

## Models

You can use Cursor with two AI models. 
* GPT-3.5: Reliable for simple queries. Fast. Available to all users. 
* GPT-4: Very good at coding. Slow. Available to pro subscribers.
